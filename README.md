# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This single page application was designed by Justin Diaz during week 4 of Lighthouse labs' web development bootcamp. Creating this page required usage of HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. Stringing together Jquery methods had a learning curve during development, but reading through the docs to piece it together improved my skills as a developer.

 As it currently stands this SPA makes asynchronous requests for tweets to the back-end. When it recieves tweets it will render a new tweet template for all tweet recieved. 

 This page is both mobile and desktop friendly!
